The auto delete old posts WordPress plugin will keep your website clean by programmatically deleting old posts with a wide range of powerful filters and conditions.

== Description ==
Deleting the old posts in WordPress is a time-consuming task.
With the Delete Old Posts Automatically plugin, you can make this task automatically.

Just set the value for the number of days in the past, and the plugin will automatically delete any post that was published before that.
You can also filter the deleted posts if you want to skip some of them and keep some important ones.

Any blog accumulates, over time, a considerable number of blog posts. If your old blog posts are out-of-date, irrelevant, of poor quality, not useful, don’t get much traffic, and don’t support your blog’s overall goals, you should consider removing them. If your website has hundreds of old posts, deleting them is a time-consuming task.
If any of these blog posts still have organic traffic, it will be automatically redirected, with a 301 code, to the best matching related post.

With the help of this plugin, you will be able to **delete the posts automatically** and thus save a lot of time. You can decide to permanently delete the posts or put them in the trash.
You can also delete any custom posts, such as WooCommerce products, with ease.
